		I'm about to learn you a thing or two about neurolinguistic programming, buckle your seatbelts.

		<li>
			<ul>Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is an approach to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy.</ul>
			<ul> It was created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in California, United States in the 1970s.</ul>
			<ul> I first learned about it from the book "Unleash the Power Within" by Tony Robbins.</ul>
			<ul> It's super neato and can be used to rewire your brain towards success and fulfillment.</ul>
